# Marineboom_aColor
Design, control, and stabilization of lightweight and corrosion resistant hydraulic boom are presented in this repository. 
This project was a part of my master thesis. 
Objective of this project was to create a basic 3D model, structural analysis, control, stabilization and simulation of a hydraulic boom.
Read the file report to understant the things better.
These simulation programs are coded using Matlab script. 
To run the simulations, u can just go to the run.m or run_me.m and run the file.
